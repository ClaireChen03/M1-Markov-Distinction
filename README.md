Title: Slime Mold Markov Walk

Author: Claire Chen

Description: A simple two-hue visual stimulation that is inspired by slime mold foraging activity. On a piece of canvas, "food pellets" of two different colors are scattered randomly. Slime mold-like agents then explore the space for food. They take on the color of the food as they go, and leave a trace behind with their color, updating transition probabilities of possible actions for each point on the canvas. The end result is a two-hue painted canvas, which shows the trails that the agents have reinforced over time for their food search. Decisions made by each agent at each point depend on the transition state of the current position, which follows the Markov principle.

Inspiration and story behind this project: I am always fascinated by biological systems. One system I am particularily fascinated with is slime mold foraging behavior. When it comes to path and efficiency optimization, we are nowhere near its rival. Though the intricacies of slime mold behavior are too complex to fully model given my current skillset, it would be cool to make art mimicking their behavior in the simplist way possible. There are many artists that make art with slime mold in real life, creating colorful and wonderful foraging networks. What if I could so something similar but digitally? Hence this project.

Personal challenges:


Is this a creative System?
Yes.

Some other notes:
- Generating circular food pellets reminded me of "circles" in Minecraft. Damn, should have done this project in Minecraft.
